# Points Spending Application
### Description
This project allows for a user to spend points stored in a transactions.csv file and outputs the total remaining points balances for each payer that was in the original transactions file.

### Necessary libraries
The only necessary libraries are the `sys` and `csv` libraries which come preinstalled with python3.

### Using this project
In order to run this project, ensure that you are in the same directory as `PointsSpend.py` and your transactions csv file. Then to run the program, use `python3 PointsSpend.py [spend amount] [transactions filename]` in a command prompt window.
